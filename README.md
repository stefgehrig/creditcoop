This repository contains data and analysis code for the manuscript **"Societal norms of cooperation could foster microcredit repayment under group lending"**.

To reproduce the analyses, the `modeling.R` script has to be run as a first step. It imports the required data and the helper functions stored in `functions.R`, and runs all Bayesian models. 
The `produce_outputs.R` script uses the modeling outputs to create figures and tables.
